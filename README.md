#### Emacs Setup
Likely my setup is quite terrible but... here it is!

I refer to this file when setting up an Emacs environment on new machines.

Steps:
1. Place the emacs file contents into the ~/.emacs file or ~/.emacs.d/...
2. In the `emacs` file, delete the "Emacs autogenerated" section.
3. Install any missing packages
    * M-x list-packages > C-s dired-subtree > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s smex > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s ace-mc > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s expand-region > install this package   (Melpa version)
    * M-x list-packages > C-s tide > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s spacemacs-theme > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s yasnippet > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s yasnippet-snippets > install this package
    * M-x list-packages > C-s elpy > install this package
4. Setup Yasnippet
   * Navigate to .emacs.d directory and add a folder named 'snippets/'.
   * Place the various '...-mode/' (such as c++-mode) directories into the new 'snippets/' directory.
   * Make a copy of the 'python-mode/class' file into the 'elpa/elpy-.../snippets/python-mode/' directory.
5. Change theme to the newly installed spacemacs theme.
   * Options > Customize Emacs > Custom Themes
   * Click the spacemacs-dark theme
   * Click 'Save Theme Settings' IMPORTANT!
6. Add line numbers
   * Options > Show/Hide > Line Numbers in Mode Line
5. Restart Emacs
    * C-x C-c


Troubleshooting During Set Up:
* If a package listed above, such as dired-subtree or others, isn't listed when using `M-x list-packages` try commenting out all lines in the .emacs file and keep `(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))`
